# Lung-X-Ray-Interpreter
## Interprets x-rays of lungs to diagnose various conditions

#### Chest x-rays are a noninvasive tool often used to diagnose lung conditions. They are usually read by radiologists, who are trained to interpret the x-rays. Sometimes, however, radiologists are unavailable (such as in rural or remote areas) and in such cases, a tool that can read and interpret the x-ray would prove useful. This model can serve as the backend of such a tool, taking images of chest x-rays and predicting, with 85% accuracy, whether the lungs are healthy or diseased with pneumonia, Covid-19, or tuberculosis.
